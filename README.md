## Assessment Tasks

1. Use ajax to grab data from the provided json file and display each row from the data as a bootstrap card within the div with the id `card-parent`.
- refer to 

2. When you hover over p tag with the id `p-for-hover`, change its text to "Hovering over a p". When you stop hovering over that p, change its text back to the original text.

3. When you click on any of the three buttons with the class `color-button`, turn that button's background color to `green`. When you click on a different `color-button`, the previously clicked button's color should return to its original color of `orange`.

4. When you click on the h1 element with the id `border-toggle`, display a 3px solid `red` border around it. If you click the `border-toggle` again, the border disappears.

5. When you click the button with the id `add-row`, add a row to the table body with id of `simple-table-body`. The row should have 3 columns (or table data items): the number of the row that is being added (starting with 1 for the first row that is added), "hello", and "world". E.g., the first time you click the `add-row` button, a row will be appended containing the columns "1", "hello", and "world". The second time you click the `add-row` button, another row will be appended to the table with the values "2", "hello", and "world". Note that the table is initially empty.

6. Use JavaScript to add 7 list items to the unordered list with the id `lots-of-list-items`. The first list item you add should display the text `Item 4`. The second list item you add should display the text `Item 5`, and so on.  

7. Whenever any `<li>` is clicked, display that item's text to console.log
